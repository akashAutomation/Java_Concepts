 1. The underlined data structure is Double LinkedList.
 2. Duplicates are allowed.
 3. Insertion Order is preserved.
 4. Heterogenous objects are allowed. 
 5. Null insertion is possible.
 6. LinkedList implements Serializable and Clonable interfaces but not RandomAccess inerface.
 7. LinkedList is the best choice if our frequent operation is insertion or deletion in middle.
 8. LinkedList is the worst choice if our frequent operation is retrieval operation.
 9. usually we can use LinkedList to implement stacks and queue. To provide support for this requirements LinkedList class
    defines following specific methods.
         void addFirst();
         void addLast();
         Object getFirst();
         Object getLast();
         Object removeFirst();
         Object removeLast();
         
 10. LinkedList Constructors:
       1. LinkedList l = new LinkedList(); --> creates an empty LinkedList Object.       
       2. LinkedList l = new LinkedList(Collection c); --> creates an equivalent LinkedList Object for the given collection.  
       
 11. It is not thread safe.
