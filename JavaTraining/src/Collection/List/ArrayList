 1. The underlined data structure is Resizable Array or Growable Array.
 2. Duplicates are allowed
 3. Insertion Order is preserved.
 4. Heterogeneous objects are allowed(except TreeSet & TreeMap everywhere heterogeneous objects are allowed)

 - Homogeneous objects → All elements are of the same type.
 Example: List<Integer> contains only integers.
 - Heterogeneous objects → Elements are of different types.
 Example: List<Object> can contain an Integer, a String, a Double, or even a custom class object in the same list.

 5. Null insertion is possible.
 
 6. ArrayList Constructors -->
  
    1. ArrayList al = new ArrayList(); --> Raw type, can hold any object
       Creates an empty ArrayList object with default initial capacity 10. Once array list reaches its max capacity a new arraylist
       will be created with new capacity:
       				new capacity = (current capacity * 3/2)+1
       				
    2. ArrayList al = new ArrayList(int initialCapacity);
    	Creates an empty array list object with initialCapacity.
    	ex-> if we want to store large data so we can provide initialCapacity so it will improve the performance. If we will not provide
    	     initialCapacity then it will start with 10, 16, 25...and will reduce the performance. 
    	
    3. ArrayList al = new ArrayList(Collection c);   				
       	It is used for interconversion of any Collection: linkedList to arraylist, vector to arraylist, TreeSet to arraylist  etc.		
       				
 7. ArrayList is best choice if our frequent operation is retrieval operation(Because ArrayList implements RandomAccess Interface).
 8. ArrayList is the worst choice if our frequent operation is insertion or deletion in middle(Because several shift operation are require).
 
 9. ArrayList is not threadSafe.
    thread safety --> When multiple threads are working on the same data and the value of our data is changing, that scenario is not thread-safe
                      and we will get inconsistent result.
                      
                      When a thread is already working on an object and preventing another thread on working on the same object, this 
                      process is called Thread safety.
 
 10. A synchronized list in Java is a thread-safe version of a List where all operations are synchronized,
     meaning only one thread can access the list at a time.
 11. By default ArrayList is non-synchronized but we can get synchronized version of ArrayList by using Collection class synchronizedList() method.

       method signature --> public static List synchronizedList(List i)
 
       Non-synchronized  --> ArrayList al = new ArrayList();
       
       synchronized  -->  List l = Collection.synchronizedList(al);
