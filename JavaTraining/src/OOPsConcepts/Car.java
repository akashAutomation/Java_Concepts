/* 1. Class --> A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which 
			objects	are created. It is a logical entity. It can not be physical.
	
   2. When we create any class in java then always it's parent class will be "Object" class which is present in java.lang package.
   3. Object class is the root of the class hierarchy
   4. If we are not extending any class in child class then always it's parent or super class will be Object class by default.
   5. If we are extending any class in child class then Object class will not be it's parent class but indirectly it will be
      it's super class
      ex-> class A extends B --> here parent class of A is B and suppose B is not extending any class then Object class will be parent class
           of B and indirectly Object class will be super class of A also.
   6. One child class can have only one parent class.
            
	
   Object --> Object is an instance of a class. An entity that has state and behavior is known an object.
   		      It can be physical or logical
