🧩 What is an Exception?
- An exception is an object that indicates an error or unusual condition in a program.
- When an exception occurs, the JVM stops normal execution and looks for code to handle it.
- If not handled, the program terminates abnormally.
- At the top of the hierarchy is Throwable, which has two main branches:
    Throwable
     ├── Exception
     │    ├── Checked Exceptions
     │    │    ├── IOException
     │    │    ├── SQLException
     │    │    └── FileNotFoundException
     │    └── RuntimeException (Unchecked)
     │         ├── NullPointerException
     │         ├── ArithmeticException
     │         └── ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
     └── Error
          ├── OutOfMemoryError
          ├── StackOverflowError
          └── VirtualMachineError


🔑 Types of Exceptions in Java
- Checked Exceptions:
    - Verified at compile time.
    - Must be either handled with try-catch or declared with throws.
    - Examples: IOException, SQLException, FileNotFoundException.

- Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions):
    - Occur during runtime, not checked at compile time.
    - Examples: NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

- Errors:
    - Serious problems that applications should not try to handle.
    - Examples: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError.

🧪 Exception Handling Keywords
- try → Block of code that may throw an exception.
- catch → Block that handles the exception.
- finally → Block that always executes (used for cleanup like closing files).
- throw → Used to explicitly throw an exception.
- throws → Declares exceptions a method may throw.

⚖️ Why Exception Handling Matters
- Prevents program crashes.
- Provides meaningful error messages.
- Ensures resources (files, DB connections) are safely closed.
- Improves reliability and maintainability of applications.


🧩 What is StackOverflowError?
- Definition: It’s a runtime error in Java that occurs when the call stack memory is exhausted.
- Type: It’s an Error, not an Exception → meaning it’s a serious issue that applications typically shouldn’t try to handle.
- Package: java.lang.StackOverflowError.
- Cause: Usually caused by deep or infinite recursion (a method calling itself endlessly without a proper base condition).
- Solution: - Increase stack size (via JVM options like -Xss) only if recursion depth is valid and unavoidable.
            - Optimize algorithms to avoid excessive method calls.
