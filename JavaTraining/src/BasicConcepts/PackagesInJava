--> Packages are nothing more than the way we organize files into different directories according to their functionality, usability as
    well as category they should belong to.
    
--> ex: files in java.io package do something related to I/O, but files in java.net package give us the way to deal with the Network.

--> Packaging also help us to avoid class name collision when we use the same class name as that of others.

--> The benefits of using package reflect the ease if maintenance, organization and increase collaboration among developers.
