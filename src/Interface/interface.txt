Introduction:

> An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class, containing only method signatures (no implementations) and constants.
> Interfaces are similar to abstract class but having all the methods of abstract type.
> Interface is abstract in nature --> we can achieve 100% abstraction.
> By default, interfaces in Java are abstract and public, even if you don’t explicitly declare them:
  interface MyInterface { // By default public and abstract
      void doSomething();
  }
> Interface cannot be private, default and protected.
> class implements interface1, interface2
> interface extends interface1, interface2
> If a class is implementing any Interface then it is mandatory to define/override all the methods of Interface.
> We can not create the object of Interface. It will give compilation error "interface is abstract; cannot be instantiated" if you try.
  USBank s = new USBank(); --> cannot create object for interface

> Interface do not have constructors. It will give compilation error "Constructor is not allowed in interface".
  public USBank{}; --> Constructor is not allowed in interface

Variables in interface:
> variable's default nature - variables are by default public, static, final in nature.
> Variable value will not be changed because it is final/constant in nature
> variables can not be private, default, protected in interfaces.

Methods in interface:
> method's default nature - methods are by default public, abstract in nature.
> No main method in interface.
> methods can not be protected, final in interfaces.
> Java 8 introduced the ability to define static methods with body in interfaces. without method body, we cannot create static method.
  static void a(){
        System.out.println("interface US bank- static method ");
  };

> Java 8 introduced the ability to define default methods with body in interfaces. without method body, we cannot create static method.
  default void b(){
          System.out.println("interface US bank- default method ");
  };

> Java 9 introduced the ability to define private methods with body in interfaces. without method body, we cannot create static method.
  private void c(){
          System.out.println("interface US bank- private method ");
  };

Syntax :-
interface InterfaceName
{
	// public static final variables (constants)
	// public abstract methods
}

Use of Interfaces :-
1. Used to achieve 100% abstraction in Java.
2. Used to define a common behaviour across unrelated classes.
3. Used to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.
4. Used to achieve loose coupling in our code.
5. Used extensively in frameworks, APIs, and design patterns (e.g., DAO, Service Layer).

Nested interface:
A nested interface is an interface declared within another class or interface. They are by default static in nature.
Ex:
within interface:
        interface Outer {
            interface Inner {
                void run(); // implicitly public
            }
        }

within class :
        class OuterClass {
            interface NestedInterface {
                void display();
            }
        }

Note: Nested interface have different scope of access modifiers if it is created in class or in interface.

Context	             Modifier Allowed	                      Default nature	   static      final     abstract
Inside a class	     public, private, protected, default	  default	           yes         no        yes
Inside an interface	 public	                                  public	           yes         no        yes
