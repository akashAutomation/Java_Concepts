Poly - many 
morphs - forms

Polymorphism in Java is a core concept of object-oriented programming that allows objects to take on many forms.
More precisely, it means that a single method call can behave differently depending on the actual object type
that it’s acting on — even if the reference type is the same.

1. One name but multiple forms is called polymorphism.
2. polymorphism only applies to instance methods(non-static methods), not static ones.

two types
	1. Static or compile time polymorphism or Early binding --> ex.- Overloading
	2. Dynamic or Run time polymorphism or late binding  --> ex.- Overriding

Why Polymorphism Matters:
1. Enables flexible and reusable code
2. Supports dynamic method dispatch
3. Makes it easier to work with interfaces and abstract classes
4. Helps implement design patterns like Strategy, Command, and Observer


Method Hiding:
    In Java, method hiding occurs when a static method in a subclass has the same signature
    as a static method in its superclass. It’s similar to method overriding, but applies only to
    static methods — and the behavior is quite different.


Why Method Hiding Is Not Polymorphism:
   Static methods are resolved at compile time, based on the reference type, not the object.
   There's no dynamic dispatch — the JVM doesn’t look at the actual object type.
   You don’t get polymorphic behavior when hiding static methods.

   method hiding and top casting do intersect conceptually, but they’re not the same. but it’s not the same thing. Top casting affects both static and instance method calls,
   but only instance methods behave polymorphically.
   They are different because
   method hiding applies on static methods and top casting applies on non static methods.
