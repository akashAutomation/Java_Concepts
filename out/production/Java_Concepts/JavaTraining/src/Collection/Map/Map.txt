1. Map is not the child interface of Collection because a Map represents a fundamentally
 	              different data structure: it stores key–value pairs, not just individual elements like
 	              a Collection does.
2. If we want to represent a group of individual objects as key value pairs then we should go for Map interface.
   ex- RollNo.   Name
 		101       a
 		102		  b
 	    103       a

3. Both key and value are objects, duplicated keys are not allowed but values can be duplicated.
4. Common Implementations: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, HashTable


### 🧭 Java Map Implementations and Ordering

| Map Type           | Sorted by Keys?   | Maintains Insertion Order?   | Notes |
|--------------------|------------------ |----------------------------- |-------|
| `HashMap`          | ❌ No             | ❌ No                        | Unordered; fast access |
| `LinkedHashMap`    | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes                       | Preserves insertion order |
| `TreeMap`          | ✅ Yes            | ❌ N/A                       | Sorted by natural key order or custom comparator |
| `Hashtable`        | ❌ No             | ❌ No                        | Legacy; thread-safe but unordered |
| `ConcurrentHashMap`| ❌ No             | ❌ No                        | Thread-safe; no ordering guarantees |
