 Collection --> If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then we should go for collection.

 Collection framework --> It defines several classes and interfaces which can be used to represent a group of objects as single entity.

 Collection v/s Collections --> Collection is an interface which can be used to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity.
 							   
 							   Collections is an utility class present in java.util.package to define several utility methods(like Sorting, Searching etc.)
 							   for Collection objects.
 
 key interfaces in collection -->
 	1. Collection --> 1. Collection interface defines most common methods which are applicable for any collection object.
 					  2. In general it is considered as root interface of collection framework.

	2. List --> 1. List is child interface of Collection.
				2. If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity where duplicates are allowed and insertion order
				   preserved then we should go for List. (it means that the elements are stored and retrieved in the same
				   sequence in which they were added.)
				3. Common Implementations: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack
				   
	3. Set --> 1. It is child interface of Collection.
			   2. If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity where duplicates are not allowed and insertion order
				  not preserved then we should go for Set because the underlying data structures (hash tables, trees) are optimized for uniqueness
				  and performance, not for maintaining sequence.
			   3. Common Implementations: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet

        3(a) SortedSet --> 1. It is child interface of Set.
					       2. If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity where duplicates are not allowed but all
					          objects should be inserted according to some sorting order then we should go for Sorted set.

	    3(b). NavigableSet --> 1. It is child interface of Sorted Set.
					           2. It defines several methods for navigation purposes(like lower(), floor(), ceiling(), higher()).

					
	4. Queue --> 1. It is child interface of Collection.
				 2. If we want to represent a group of individual objects prior to processing(i.e. FIFO-first in first out)	then we should
				    go for queue.
				 3. Common Implementations: PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque

 Note --> 1. All the above interfaces(Collection, List, Set and Queue) meant for representing a group of individual objects.
 		  2. If we want to represent a group of objects as key value pairs then we should go for Map interface.
 		  
 	5. Map --> 1. Map is not the child interface of Collection because a Map represents a fundamentally
 	              different data structure: it stores key–value pairs, not just individual elements like
 	              a Collection does.
 			   2. If we want to represent a group of individual objects as key value pairs then we should go for Map interface.
 			   ex- RollNo.   Name
 			       101       a
 			       102		 b
 			       103       a
 			       
 			   3. Both key and value are objects, duplicated keys are not allowed but values can be duplicated.
 			   4. Common Implementations: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, HashTable

        5(a) SortedMap --> 1. It is the child interface of Map.
 					 2. If we want to represent a group of key value pairs according to some sorting order of keys then we should
 					    go for SortedMap.
 					    		   
 	    5(b). NavigableMap -->	1. It is the child interface of SortedMap.
 						2. It defines several utility methods for navigation purpose.
